ASSIGNMENT 1

# My first question (1)
# To find the average of three numbers taken by the user

# first step taking the inputs and converting it into integer
n1 = int(input("Enter the first number\n"))
n2 = int(input("Enter your second number\n"))
n3 = int(input("Enter your third number\n"))
# now the input has been taken so the next step is to print the average oh three
# so as we know to find average we have to add all the number divided by count of number how many they are
print("The average of these three numbers is\n", (n1+n2+n2) / 3)
# so at last you will get your answer and it will be in form of float

# here \n is the new line character which print the next line in a new line
